                           Lately I've been obsessed with making bread. My neighbour brought me a nice load of bread one day and told me about his baking skills. I was intrigued and decided to give it a go.

                            I always said I never wanted to get married. Looking back I'm not sure about the exact reasons but I convinced myself, and everyone around me, that it would never happen.
                            Since <Link href="/moving-to-spain" className="hyperlink">we moved to Spain</Link> I noticed I've been thinking about it more often.

                            So I did what a man had to do. Got a nice ring and asked her in front of our kids. She said yes ‚ù§Ô∏è. It was everything I wanted it to be. So we're getting married somewhere in 2024.

                                Added a page to the website to keep a track of the things I'm working on and whenever I'm changing things to the website.
                                Backfilled the page with the entries I knew about. It's clear that I spend more time updating this blog than writing actual content.
